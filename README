"dia" is a german word for "Reversal film".

This is a small dockapp, which does nearly nothing. 
It just creates an empty window with a 62x62 background pixmap.

When you click on the window, the command in the property "COMMAND" is executed.
When you move the mouse in the window the text in the property "TOOLTIP" is
shown as tooltip.

The main goal was to have a slideshow in a dockapp window, but it can also be
used to show films, webcam in the dockapp or just a simple command button.

To compile you must have libxcb (xcb-dev) installed.

xprop can be used to modify the wmdia properties.
xwininfo can be used to find the window id.

Just make make and play.

Use wmdia -h to see the command-line options.
