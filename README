"dia" is a german word for "Reversal film".

This is a small dockapp, which does nearly nothing. 
It just creates an empty window with a 62x62 background pixmap.

When you click on the window, the command in the property "COMMAND" is executed.
When you move the mouse in the window the text in the property "TOOLTIP" is
shown as tooltip.

To compile you must have libxcb (xcb-dev) installed.

xprop can be used to modify the wmdia properties.
xwininfo can be used to find the window id.

Just make make and play.

Requires:
	x11-libs/libxcb
		X C-language Bindings library
		http://xcb.freedesktop.org/


Example scripts:

	- diashow.sh
		Show pictures in wmdia.
	- playvideo.sh
		Play a video in wmdia.
	- set-command.sh
		How to change the command executed by wmdia.
	- set-tooltop.sh
		How to change the tooltop shown by wmdia.
